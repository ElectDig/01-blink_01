    Austral 2023 - ELectronica Digital - EAM

##      Hardware

        ESP32 development board
        Tact switch
        External LED
        220 ohm resistor
        Dupont cables

##      Connections

        From GND on ESP32 development board to negative rail - (blue one)
        From GPIO 'PUSH' to one side of Tact switch
        From the other side of Tact switch to negative rail

        From GND to LED cathode
        From LED anode to 220 resistor
        Form other end of 220 resistor to GPIO 'LED'
